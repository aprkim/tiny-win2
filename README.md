## 🌟 Overview

Tiny Wins is a minimalist daily task management app designed to help you build consistent habits through small, achievable daily goals. Unlike traditional to-do apps, Tiny Wins distinguishes between **recurring daily habits** and **one-time tasks**, making it perfect for habit tracking.

## ✨ Features

### Two Types of Tasks

| Task Type | Color | Behavior |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Daily Template** | Warm beige border | Resets every day - perfect for habits |
